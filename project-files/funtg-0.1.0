  :description "A library for handling TGraphs.  Includes the functional query
  API FunQL and the transformation APIs FunML and FunTL.

  Everything's totally pre-pre-pre-alpha and subject to frequent, incompatible
  changes.  Ok, you've been warned, but have fun anyway. :-)

  ATTENTION: This is the final release.  This library will be continued under
  the new name FunnyQT (funnyqt)."
